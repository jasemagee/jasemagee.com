<h3>Watching - Fun games they can watch you play</h3>

<h4>Subnautica</h4>

<p>
    Subnautica is a survival crafting game in which you crash land on an ocean planet. The objective is to escape by eventually building a platform allowing your to make a rocket.
The game is non-combat and while the game has colorful cartoony visuals, can be quite scary. This is why Iâ€™ve placed it in the watching category.
The scariness comes from exploring with limit oxygen - it can be quite unsettleting to get lost in a cave system and not know why was is up for example.
Another scary element is the huge levaithons that can be found in the depths, which are also part of the story. My eldest found the leviathons interesting,
partiucarly when we discovered the bones of an ancient one very deep using my submarine.

<h3>Playing Together</h3>

<h4>Planet Crafter</h4>

<p>
    Planet Crafter is a survival crafting game with no combat whatsoever. My eldest and I play this on our PCs together.
You start on a uninhabitable planet and gradually terraform the planet to be habitable. You see the gardual change from a barren wasteland to the arrival of water, planets, insets and animals.

<p>
    I think this is quite a good introduction to lots of subjects and encourages convesations around those.
We have the actual terraforming itself, what makes a planet habitable, the various materials you collect,
different types of power (solar, wind, nuclear, etc.), the management of resouces and recycling of scarce materials.

<p>It also encourages learning of some more complicated words e.g. aliminium, uranium, titanium, etc.</p>
