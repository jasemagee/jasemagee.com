Here is a link to the map on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2402253419). You need to own C&amp;C: Remastered in order to play it.

> "Commander, there are three Radar Domes you need to destroy. We have provided you with a Cruiser near the south-west Radar Dome, which also holds two Demo Trucks that could come in handy. Remember: the most direct path is not always the easiest. Tanya must survive."
