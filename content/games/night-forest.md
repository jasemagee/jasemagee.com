summary: An attempt to create a small horror game
---

Here's my attempt to create a small horror game using Unity. 
Arrows or WASD to move. Mouse to do things.

Apologies for the terrible sound effects, I tried to make them myself and it did not go well...

You can play it [here](https://jasemagee.itch.io/night-forest).
