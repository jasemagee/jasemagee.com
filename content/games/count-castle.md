summary: Tile based counting game for kids
---

A small tile-based game with simple mechanics aimed at kids. Count apples to defeat cute blob monsters, avoid holes, collect coins and find the exit.


Up/Left/Down/Right or WASD to move, mouse to interact and number keys for counting.

Tested on a 5 year old (not harmed) who appeared to enjoy it.
