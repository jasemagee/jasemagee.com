<p>
    Greetings! I am a software developer based in Guernsey with over 20 years of professional experience. My wife, Joelle, and I are proud parents of two sons: Th√©oden (inspired by the character from Lord of the Rings, affectionately nicknamed Teddy) and Rowan.
</p>

<p>
    I successfully managed my own company for four years before joining a dynamic team of talented developers at <a href="https://cortex.gg">Cortex</a>, where I continue to contribute to innovative projects.
</p>

<p>
    I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Games Programming. For my final year project, I designed and implemented a 2D game engine in C++, complemented by a level editor created in C#. This project highlighted the importance of efficient tool development in game production.

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<p>
    With over 20 years of experience delivering software solutions in Guernsey, I have collaborated with professionals across various industries, including accounting, investment, human resources, compliance, healthcare, and logistics. My focus has consistently been on improving operational efficiency while adhering to evolving data compliance requirements. Over the years, I have contributed to a diverse range of projects, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Developing accounting systems (e.g., accounts, trial balances)</li>
    <li>Building bookkeeping solutions (e.g., reconciliation tools, bank statement imports)</li>
    <li>Designing automated billing platforms</li>
    <li>Creating compliance engines to search databases against UN, UK, and US sanction lists</li>
    <li>Implementing bespoke charting solutions for large datasets</li>
    <li>Generating custom reports with complex display rules for pages, charts, and text</li>
    <li>Developing investment portfolio comparison tools</li>
    <li>Creating interfaces for legacy systems (e.g., VMS and Delphi) to facilitate transitions to modern platforms</li>
    <li>Building Content Management Systems (CMS) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions</li>
    <li>Delivering software solutions layered over legacy databases to phase out outdated systems</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I have also worked on website development for small businesses, self-employed professionals, and charitable organizations. These smaller projects are particularly meaningful to me, as I enjoy supporting individuals and organizations embarking on new ventures. Additionally, I manage several virtual servers hosted in the UK for personal projects and occasionally offer managed hosting services.
</p>

<p>
    My passion for knowledge-sharing has led me to deliver presentations at the <a href="http://www.digitalgreenhouse.gg/">Digital Greenhouse Guernsey</a>, primarily as part of their Lunch &#38; Code series, as well as for other events. I have also spoken to the coding club at St Martin's School about game development, which, admittedly, was more nerve-wracking than presenting to adults. Beyond this, I serve as the site manager for the Guernsey Global Game Jam.
</p>

<p>
    I am proud to have provided pro bono hosting support for charitable organizations such as Chest &amp; Heart and Hope for a Child, continuing my commitment to community engagement.
</p>

<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
<p>
    In my spare time, I immerse myself in a variety of personal projects. A significant portion of my free time is dedicated to game development through <a href="https://granitegames.gg/">Granite Games</a>. While primarily a passion project, I remain optimistic about its potential commercial success despite the challenges of the industry. Additionally, I co-founded <a href="https://data.gg/">data.gg</a> with Kieran Senior in 2014, and I continue to actively contribute to its growth and development.
</p>
