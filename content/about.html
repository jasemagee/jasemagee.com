            Hello, I am a Guernsey based software consultant with 15 years of experience.
            My wife Joelle and I have two sons, one named Th√©oden (yes, from Lord of the Rings; we call
            him Teddy for short) and Rowan.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started programming when I went to University and did a BSc in Computer Games Programming.
            For my final year project I created my own 2D game engine in (C++) which could be accessed by a level
            editor (C#) to demonstrate rapid tool development.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            In 2017 I lost 25kg/4 stone/25% of my body weight. I've gone from disliking jogging to jogging daily
            and have managed to complete 20 half-marathons. Despite becoming very active, I continue to enjoy
            trying different ales and playing video games to relax.
        </p>

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>
    During my 15 years delivering software in the finance industry I have worked with accountants, bookkeepers,
    investment consultants, human resources and compliance to deliver tools primarily to boost efficiency
    but also to help keep in-line with the ever changing requirements surrounding data law. I have worked
    on...
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Accounting systems (accounts, trial balances, etc.)</li>
    <li>Book keeping systems (reconciling, bank statement import, etc.)</li>
    <li>Automated billing systems</li>
    <li>Engines to search databases against UN, UK and US sanction list entries for compliance purposes</li>
    <li>Bespoke charting of large datasets</li>
    <li>Bespoke report generation with lots of rules surrounding what pages, charts, text, etc. are displayed</li>
    <li>Investment portfolio comparison</li>
    <li>Interfaces to old systems such as VMS and Delphi to alleviate the burden of changing to new systems</li>
    <li>Content Management Systems and Customer Relationship Management</li>
    <li>Building software against existing legacy databases to deprecate and replace old software</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Beyond the finance industry I also create websites for small local companies, self-employed people and charities.
    I'm not sure why these have been smaller operations, perhaps because I have a soft spot for people trying to start
    something new. As I host a lot of personal projects I have quite a few virtual servers hosted in the UK and
    occasionally provide managed hosting.
</p>

<p>
    I have done a number of presentations at the <a href="http://www.digitalgreenhouse.gg/">Digital Greenhouse Guernsey</a>,
    primarily for Lunch &#38;&#38; Code but also the occasional adhoc one. Additionally, I've also spoken at a
    St Martin's School Coding Club about games development (which was more intimidating than talking to adults).
    I am a site manager for the Guernsey Global Games Jam which happens in January every year.
</p>

<p>I have been supporting the Chest &amp; Heart pro bono and Hope for a Child at hosting cost for many years.</p>

<h2>Spare Time</h2>
<p>
    In my spare time I have a number of on-going and deceased personal projects. Primarily my spare time is used
    creating games with my friend Marc over at <a href="https://granitegames.gg/">Granite Games</a>
    for fun and perhaps one day, for some profit; the games industry is brutal to break in to. I founded
    <a href="https://data.gg/">data.gg</a> in 2014 with Kieran Senior and continue to work on that.
</p>


<h2>Technical Specialities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Microsoft .NET technologies (Full, Core, ASP, MVC, Blazor)</li>
    <li>Linux &#38; Windows server-side development</li>
    <li>Windows client-side desktop software</li>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>DevExpress &#38; Telerik UI desktop and web tools</li>
