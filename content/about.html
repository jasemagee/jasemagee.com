<p>
    Hello! I am a software consultant based in Guernsey with over 20+ years of experience. My wife, Joelle, and I have two sons: Théoden (yes, inspired by Lord of the Rings; we call him Teddy for short) and Rowan.
</p>

<p>
    I successfully ran my own company for four years before joining a team of like-minded developers at <a href="https://cortex.gg">Cortex</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I hold a BSc in Computer Games Programming. For my final year project, I developed a 2D game engine in C++, which could be accessed via a level editor built in C#. This demonstrated the rapid development of tools.

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>
    Over the span of 20+ years delivering software solutions in Guernsey, I have collaborated with a diverse range of professionals, including accountants, bookkeepers, investment consultants, human resources, compliance officers, healthcare providers, and courier services. My primary focus has been to enhance efficiency while ensuring compliance with the ever-evolving data law requirements. I have worked on projects such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Accounting systems (e.g., accounts, trial balances)</li>
    <li>Bookkeeping systems (e.g., reconciling, bank statement imports)</li>
    <li>Automated billing systems</li>
    <li>Engines to search databases against UN, UK, and US sanction lists for compliance purposes</li>
    <li>Bespoke charting of large datasets</li>
    <li>Custom report generation with complex rules for displaying pages, charts, text, etc.</li>
    <li>Investment portfolio comparison tools</li>
    <li>Interfaces for legacy systems such as VMS and Delphi to ease transitions to new systems</li>
    <li>Content Management Systems (CMS) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems</li>
    <li>Software solutions built over existing legacy databases to deprecate and replace outdated software</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Additionally, I have created websites for small local companies, self-employed individuals, and charities. These smaller projects resonate with me, perhaps due to my supportive inclination toward those initiating new ventures. Given my extensive hosting of personal projects, I manage several virtual servers hosted in the UK and occasionally offer managed hosting services.
</p>

<p>
    I have delivered numerous presentations at the <a href="http://www.digitalgreenhouse.gg/">Digital Greenhouse Guernsey</a>, primarily for their Lunch &#38; Code series, and occasionally for ad-hoc events. I have also addressed the coding club at St Martin's School about game development—an experience more intimidating than speaking to adults. Furthermore, I serve as the site manager for the Guernsey Global Game Jam.
</p>

<p>
    For many years, I have provided pro bono hosting support for Chest &amp; Heart and Hope for a Child.
</p>


<h2>Spare Time</h2>
<p>
    In my spare time, I engage in various ongoing and past personal projects. A significant portion of my free time is dedicated to creating games with <a href="https://granitegames.gg/">Granite Games</a>. While it's primarily for fun, there's always the hope that it might lead to profit one day, despite the industry's challenging nature. Additionally, I co-founded <a href="https://data.gg/">data.gg</a> with Kieran Senior in 2014, and I continue to actively contribute to its development.
</p>
