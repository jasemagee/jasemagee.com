<h4>Me</h4>
<p>
    I am a Guernsey based software consultant with 12 years of experience.
    My wife Joelle and I have an 3 year old son named Th√©oden (yes, from Lord of the Rings), we call
    him Teddy for short.
</p>

<p>
    I started programming when I went to University and did a BSc in Computer Games Programming.
    For my final year project I created my own 2D game engine in (C++) which could be accessed by a level
    editor (C#) to demonstrate rapid tool development.
</p>

<p>
    In 2017 I lost 25kg/4 stone/25% of my body weight. I've gone from disliking jogging to jogging daily
    and have managed to complete 15 half-marathons. Despite becoming very active, I continue to enjoy
    trying different ales and playing video games to relax.
</p>

<h4>Professional</h4>
<p>
    During my 12 years delivering software in the finance industry I have worked with accountants, bookkeepers,
    investment consultants, human resources and compliance to deliver tools primarily to boost efficiency
    but also to help keep in-line with the ever changing requirements surrounding data law. I have worked
    on...
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Accounting systems (accounts, trial balances, etc.)</li>
    <li>Book keeping systems (reconciling, bank statement import, etc.)</li>
    <li>Automated billing systems</li>
    <li>Engines to search databases against UN, UK and US sanction list entries for compliance purposes</li>
    <li>Bespoke charting of large datasets</li>
    <li>Bespoke report generation with lots of rules surrounding what pages, charts, text, etc. are displayed</li>
    <li>Investment portfolio comparison</li>
    <li>Interfaces to old systems such as VMS and Delphi to alleviate the burden of changing to new systems</li>
    <li>Content Management Systems and Customer Relationship Management</li>
    <li>Building software against existing legacy databases to deprecate and replace old software</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Beyond the finance industry I also create websites for small local companies, self-employed people and charities.
    I'm not sure why these have been smaller operations, perhaps because I have a soft spot for people trying to start
    something new. As I host a lot of personal projects I have quite a few virtual servers hosted in the UK and
    occasionally provide managed hosting.
</p>

<p>
    I have done a number of presentations at the <a href="http://www.digitalgreenhouse.gg/">Digital Greenhouse
        Guernsey</a>,
    primarily for Lunch &#38;&#38; Code but also the occasional adhoc one. Additionally, I've also spoken at a
    St Martin's School Coding Club about games development (which was more intimidating than talking to adults).
    I am a site manager for the Guernsey Global Games Jam which happens in January every year.
</p>

<h4>Spare Time</h4>
<p>
    In my spare time I have a number of on-going and deceased personal projects. Primarily my spare time is used
    creating games with my friend Marc over at <a href="https://granitegames.gg/">Granite Games</a>
    for fun and perhaps one day, for some profit; the games industry is brutal to break in to. I founded
    <a href="https://data.gg/">data.gg</a> in 2014 with Kieran Senior and continue to work on that.
</p>

<p>
    On the Android app store I have 3 apps...

    <div>

        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reformsoft.guernseyflights.app">
            <h5>Guernsey Flights</h5>
            <img src="/img/flights114.png">
        </a>
        <p>Monitor Guernsey Airports arrivals and departures.</p>

        <a href="/resist-calc/">
            <h5>Resist Calc</h5>
            <img src="/img/resistcalc114.png">
        </a>
        <p>Four band resistor calculator, useful for Raspberry Pi, Arduino or other electronic projects.</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p>
    <a href="/font-whiz/">Font Whiz</a> is a small open source tool I created to generate an image of
    a font from a file to help with fast font rendering in games.
</p>
</p>

<p>
    On the deceased front I ran <a href="https://gamelydigest.com/">Gamely Digest</a> with my friend Nik for a few years
    doing video game reviews which was surprisingly fun. Unfortunately, reviewing games is very time consuming and
    began to suck the fun out of playing them. I also ran <a href="http://jotter.io">Jotter</a> for a few years
    (read about closure <a href="/2017/02/re-purposing-jotter-io/">here</a>) and did quite a bit of work on a political
    voting
    website called vote.gg which you can read about the closure of <a href="/2017/02/closing-vote-gg/">here</a>.
    I toyed with not listing the deceased projects here but ultimately decided I should considering their significant
    scopes.
    After-all, they say the road to success is paved with failures. There's also
    <a href="https://discuss.gg">discuss.gg</a> which I ran as a discussion platform for Guernsey but was not used
    enough to justify
    the on-going costs.
