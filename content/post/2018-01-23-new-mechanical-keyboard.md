Just a short post to show off my new Ducky Shine 6 Mechanical Keyboard.

This is more of a refresh than an upgrade, my previous keyboard was a Das Model S Professional UK Silent which has the same Cherry MX Brown switches that the Ducky Shine 6 does. I've moved the Das into one of my regular clients as there's nothing wrong with it. It's from 2012 so before Das's standards supposedly started to slip. The obvious addition to the Ducky is the RGB lighting that can be heavily customised. I wasn't sure I would like the lighting but I've set it to slowly change colours which is subtle and not irritating.

Here's a short video of some of the lighting effects:
