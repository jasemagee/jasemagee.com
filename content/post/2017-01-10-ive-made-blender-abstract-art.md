Recently I';ve spent a lot of time learning Blender for game development and fancied experimenting with something a bit different. Below I';ve linked to two abstract art type of renders that turned out pretty good. The purple one was meant to have volumetric lighting but sadly my AMD card didn';t seem to want to render it. Fortunately it turned out okay.

Both are the ultra-wide resolution of 3440x1440 and available to do with as you please.
