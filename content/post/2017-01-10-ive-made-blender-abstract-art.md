Recently I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time learning Blender for game development and fancied experimenting with something a bit different. Below I&#8217;ve linked to two abstract art type of renders that turned out pretty good. The purple one was meant to have volumetric lighting but sadly my AMD card didn&#8217;t seem to want to render it. Fortunately it turned out okay.

Both are the ultra-wide resolution of 3440&#215;1440 and available to do with as you please.
