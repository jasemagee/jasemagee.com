title: Playing Duke Nukem 3D in 2022
---

Duke Nukem 3D was released in 1996 and sits amongst the top first person shooters of its time alongside games like Quake, Doom, etc. It is also known for the game engine under the hood called 'Build' which has been used as recently as 2019 for Ion Fury.

Playing it in 2022 turns out to be straight-forward. All you need is a...

* Legal copy of the game (GOG, Steam, Disks, etc.) so you have access to the files DUKE3D.GRP and DUKE.RTS files
* Download [EDuke32](https://www.eduke32.com/), a source port of the original and extract it
* Optionally, the [Duke Nukem 3D: High Resolution Pack](https://hrp.duke4.net/) also extracted (but bin their shareware versions of DUKE3D.GRP and DUKE.RTS)

And Voil√†, that's it!

Duke32 away.
