title: Unity Directional Sound Demo
---

Small directional audio demo in Unity, perhaps for a sound based game.

[Source code](https://github.com/jasemagee/DirectionalSoundTest)

<div class="center-align">
<a href="/img/directional-sound-demo/directional-sound-demo1.jpg"><img class="responsive-img" src="/img/directional-sound-demo/directional-sound-demo1.jpg" /></a>

</div>

Note that to make an audio source 3D in Unity, you need to drag the "Spatial Blend" slider up to 1/3D. Default is 0/2D.
