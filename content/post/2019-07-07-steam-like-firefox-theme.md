title: Steam Like Firefox Theme
---

Today I tried something new and created a Firefox Theme based on the colours of Steam. It's on the Mozilla Add-on website [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/steam-like/). The entire process was relatively painless although I'm not sure Mozilla's automated approval process was happy with the SVG so I switched to JPG.
