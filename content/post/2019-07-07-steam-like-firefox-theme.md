title: Steam Like Firefox Theme
---

Today I tried something new and created a Firefox Theme based on the colours of Steam. It's on the Mozilla Add-on website [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/steam-like/). The entire process was relatively painless although I'm not sure Mozilla's automated approval process was happy with the SVG so I switched to JPG.


<div class="center-align">
    <a href="/img/firefox/steam-like-theme.jpg">
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/firefox/steam-like-theme.jpg">
    </a>
</div>

The source code is [here](https://github.com/jasemagee/SteamLike).
