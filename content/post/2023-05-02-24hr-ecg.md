Not to turn this into a medical blog but figured it might be of interest to see what a 24hr ECG looks like. You rock up at hospital, usually early for an 24hr one.

...and return the bits to the hospital the following morning. Proceed to rush home for a lovely shower.

I **hate** having this, but it is necessary. The older version of the box was about 12 times bigger, so the small clip on one is a great improvement.
