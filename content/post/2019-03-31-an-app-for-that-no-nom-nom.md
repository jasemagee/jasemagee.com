I've recently release a new Android App to track intermittent fasting, which I've been doing in real life for a few months now. The app is mostly for my own use but figured I'd put it on the store in case it is of any interest to anyone else.

Lightweight intermittent fasting app that allows you to start a fast for a target period, get notified when the period is up and keeps a history of previous fasts.
    
Here are some screenshots from the app.
