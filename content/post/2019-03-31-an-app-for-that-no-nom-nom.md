title: 'An App for that: No Nom Nom'
---

I've recently release a new Android App to track intermittent fasting, which I've been doing in real life for a few months now. The app is mostly for my own use but figured I'd put it on the store in case it is of any interest to anyone else.


<div class="center-align">
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jasemagee.nonomnom">
        <h5>No Nom Nom</h5>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/no-nom-nom180.png">
    </a>
    <p>Lightweight intermittent fasting app that allows you to start a fast for a target period, get notified when the period is up and keeps a history of previous fasts.</p>
</div>
    
Here are some screenshots from the app.
