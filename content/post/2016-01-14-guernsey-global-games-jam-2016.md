I recently participated in the Guernsey Global Games Jam 2016 and with our team we’ve created a cracking game called ‘Sacrificial Inferno’. [Here](http://sacrificialinferno.com/) is the website.

Here are a couple of work in progress videos…

Also, I’ve uploaded a couple of real life photos from the event onto my gaming website, [gamelydigest.com](https://gamelydigest.com). See [here](https://gamelydigest.com/posts/2016/2/10/guernsey-global-games-jam-2016).
