I've recently built a new PC to replace my 9 year old one. Other than GPU upgrades and switching to solid state nothing major has been done to it. Quite a good innings for a computer used daily for both my job and gaming purposes.

I've been planning to upgrade for a while but it has been hard to justify given the cost and the fact I can still happily game on it at 3440x1440 resolution. The ultimate trigger was Docker which it struggled to run, usually running out of RAM, which was impacting my work.

## Components

I purchased the parts over a couple of months to spread the cost out.  The parts are listed below.

| Generic     | Part                                             | Cost      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Motherboard | Asus ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero                | £374.99   |
| CPU         | AMD Ryzen 9 5950X                                | £416.66   |
| RAM         | Team Group 8Pack Edition 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4      | £166.66   |
| PSU         | Corsair CP-9020139-UK HX1000 1000 W 80+ Platinum | £129.17   |
| Case        | Corsair 7000D                                    | £180.62   |
| CPU Cooler  | ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 420                     | £111.26   |
| NVMe M.2    | Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2 TB                        | £126.24   |
| Total       | Total                                            | £1,505.60 |

I have not upgraded the GPU because GPU costs are still firmly in crazy-times. I had a couple of objectives for this new build...

* Mainly to keep it as long as possible (like the previous one) so my plan was to high-end
    * PSU should last more than one PC
    * Case should last more than one PC (possibly until I expire)
* I didn't want it to be noisey so the case is *massive* and houses 11 fans (of different sizes) which run at slow speeds. It also fits extremely large CPU coolers

## AMD Ryzen Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO)

I had a little go enabling PBO after some reading about it on the Internet. It is an AMD CPU thing for overclocking. I recorded my benchmarks with/without below. I ended up turning it off, maybe one day I'll revisit but the PC is plenty fast as is.

## Conclusion

Great success!

You can't tell the PC is on when idle it's so quiet. How long it lasts will be a question for another day.

I have given my old PC to my wife and child 1 for work/play, so it will live on yet. Bonus excuse to buy another GPU in the near future...
