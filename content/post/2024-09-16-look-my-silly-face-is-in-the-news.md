I recently appeared on the main [BBC Website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gq0z5257ro) after having a phone call interview about four-day weeks. It was a surprise to us (at Cortex) that it was the proper BBC and not just BBC Guernsey.

Unfortunately, the quote was somewhat negative. I was actually more positive about it.

Anyway, it was fun seeing my face in the news!
