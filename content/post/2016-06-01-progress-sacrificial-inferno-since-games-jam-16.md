Over on [sacrificialinferno.com](https://sacrificialinferno.com) I&#8217;ve posted an [update](https://sacrificialinferno.com/2016/04/15/progress-since-the-games-jam/) on our progress to Sacrificial Inferno since the Games Jam at the end of January. Bit late posting it on my site &#8211; sorry!

## What I&#8217;m up to

I&#8217;ve been working on a mega post explaining how to build an Ubuntu version of games using GameMaker which will be posted in the coming weeks. You have to setup a Ubuntu Server, tell GameMaker how to ssh in to it and hope it builds successfully. I made the build server using Hyper-V which is my first experience with the platform. Can&#8217;t say I was very impressed &#8211; using dynamic memory allowed the guest virtual machine to use up all the hosts memory causing a Blue Screen of Death.
