I've recently had to purchase a support brace for my home PC, and I felt the need to share the absurdity of this. The GPU is **so heavy** that it is sagging out of the socket.

First, let me clarify that my GPU is not high-end; it is considered medium-end. So, this isn't even the cutting edge of GPU technology, the higher-end models are even bigger and heavier.

A team of engineers at Nvidia and AMD, working at the pinnacle of their fields, have signed off on a design that bends under its own weight. The socket that a GPU fits into is a standard and hasn't changed in many years; itâ€™s not a new innovation. Engineers! It's absolute madness.
