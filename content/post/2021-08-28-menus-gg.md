Guernsey people: I've created [menus.gg](https://menus.gg) to host local menus because a lot of local eateries don't have a website or only provide them on the dark-side (Facebook). Feel free to get in touch with any additions.

Just to clarify, it was designed to look like it is from the 1994 GeoCities catalogue!
