title: Guernsey Election 2025 Candidates
---

For the 2020 Elections, I created a spreadsheet to help people evaluate candidates. I've updated this resource for the 2025 Elections.

**[View and use the template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a2DH6cEMIFYQe6o9bGwXmmJXmzCtnnqJx6MKnCkZN_8/template/preview)**

> **Note:** Due to Google Sheets' security updates, you'll need to accept the yellow banner warning to load candidate portraits.


### How to Use the Spreadsheet

#### Step 1: Rate the Candidates
- Go through each candidate and rate them in the 'Chance for vote' column
- Use a scale of 1 (Yes) to 5 (No)
- Each row contains information about the candidate

#### Step 2: Review Your Ratings
- Check the Output sheet to see a breakdown of your voting preferences
- This shows how many candidates you've assigned to each ranking
