title: Closing up vote.gg

This is just a post to note that I&#8217;m closing up [vote.gg](http://vote.gg), I&#8217;m not going to have the time to do the project justice and I haven&#8217;t worked on it in some time. And to be honest I&#8217;ve lost faith in the system after Brexit and Donald Trump. The domain expires in 2018 &#8211; if anyone wants it for a good cause let me know. 

[vote.gg](http://vote.gg) was going to be a site for voting on and building legislation in a mash up of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org). People would be able to post the initial document and others would be able to amend and add pros/cons. After a few rounds, the document would be put to a vote. We planned to have anonymous voting and even delegated voting. Delegated voting would be saying &#8220;I know nothing about this subject but my good friend Jason Magee does &#8211; he can decide on my behalf&#8221;.

Anyway, just for portfolio purposes, I&#8217;ve attached some screenshots of how far we got as I&#8217;m going to point the domain at a simple page until it expires.
