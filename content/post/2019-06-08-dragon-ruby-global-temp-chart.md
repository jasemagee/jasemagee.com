title: DragonRuby Global Temperature Chart
---

I have a bit of a soft spot for the Ruby programming language. Something about using it is enjoyable. I've mainly used Ruby in the past for websites via Ruby on Rails so I was pretty pleased to see the Ruby games framework [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk) get released recently. During my day to day work I do a lot of maths and charting but I've never written a chart from scratch before so [here](https://jasemagee.com/dragonruby/chart-global-temp/) is my attempt at a line chart using [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk).


<div class="center-align">
    <a href="/img/dragonruby/chart-global-temp/chart-global-temp.jpg">
        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/dragonruby/chart-global-temp/chart-global-temp.jpg">
    </a>
</div>

The source code is [here](https://github.com/jasemagee/chart-global-temp/) and the global temperature data came from [here](https://datahub.io/core/global-temp).

So far my impressions of the framework are good. It's brand new so clearly isn't feature complete and I've had a few problems but the developers are doing a great job of sorting things promptly.
