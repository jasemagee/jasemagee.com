title: Updated Guernsey Flights and Sailings Android Apps
---

I've submitted updates to my Guernsey Flights and Guernsey Sailings Android Apps to the Play Store. Other than being a massive update to work with newer phones, the only notable change is that the app will only check for updates on a watched flight or sailing every 15 minutes now. This is due to battery saving measures in later versions of Android preventing me from consistently checking for updates. I'm planning to deploy both apps on Saturday the 13th of October.

You can get it sooner by opting to enter the open beta. There's a section about joining the beta on the apps store pages and you just click "Join now" to do so. Let me know if you have any problems.
