I've just wrapped up another game. This one is called 'Endure' and is a base defense game with a money system to buy upgrades between game attempts. You can buy units and upgrades. The goal is to survive 5 minutes of spider attacks.

This ended up being more of a completable demo, as I had more features in mind but lost interest in taking it further.

You can play it [here](https://jasemagee.itch.io/endure)
