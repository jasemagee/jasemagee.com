[Jotter.io](http://jotter.io) was a simplistic note taking application enabling you to take notes in three forms: notes, doodles and tables. Jotter was built in a responsive way to ensure maximum support for a variety of devices. All forms of note automatically save on the fly.

[Jotter.io](http://jotter.io) was one of my first web projects and never really took off, primary because I started using [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com) which solved the problem I had with note taking on the web and so never finished it.

I&#8217;ve decided to re-purpose [jotter.io](http://jotter.io) so the site will be re-launching soon with a new purpose!

For portfolio purposes, I&#8217;ve attached some screenshots of the app.
