At the end of 2024, my wife and I had the honor of being invited to the Chest and Heart's 50th anniversary celebration at Government House. While reflecting on this milestone, I looked back through my email history and realized that my involvement began in 2013 - 11 years ago!

Back then, my friend Kieran and I created the original website for Chest and Heart. Over the years, I’ve contributed to various updates and improvements, including a redesign to make the website responsive as mobile usage became more of a thing. More recently, the website was replaced with a new platform, but my connection with Chest and Heart continues. Through Cortex, we developed and now maintain their Portal.

My wife was also invited to the celebration, as she now works for Chest and Heart herself! Additionally, we both had the opportunity to feature in Chest and Heart's new promotional video. Naturally, I’ll be adding "modeling" to my CV!
