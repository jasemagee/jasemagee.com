Cheap and cheerful attempt at focusing on objects when looked at using Unity.

[Source code](https://github.com/jasemagee/FocusOnObjectDemo)

<div class="center-align">
Look at the red ball to focus in on it.

Move close to the TV and the camera will look at and focus on the cat.

</div>

It could be improved by slowly zooming in and out rather than happening instantly. If you wanted the TV to act as a computer it would probably be better to release the player from the look and zoom state by the movement keys instead of amount of mouse movement.
