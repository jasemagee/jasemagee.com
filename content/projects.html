<p>Along with the below I have also dipped my toes into lots of things including making

<h2>data.gg</h2>

<p><a href="https://data.gg">data.gg</a> is the brain-child of Jason Magee and Kieran Senior with the aim of providing all Bailiwick 
    of Guernsey-related data to the public through an easily accessible API in many formats which 
    suit those using it. Currently we support XML, JSON, HTML and soon we shall be supporting 
    Object data formats along with gzipped formats of all. data.gg is and will always be non-profit.</p>

<h2>Gamely Digest (Deceased)</h2>

<p<a href="https://gamelydigest.com/">Gamely Digest</a> was a pet project with my friend Nik that ran for a few years
    doing video game reviews which was surprisingly fun. Unfortunately, reviewing games is time consuming and
    began to suck the fun out of playing them. Read about the closure <a href="/post/2018-08-09-closing-up-gamely-digest/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>discuss.gg (Deceased)</h2>

<p>
discuss.gg was as a discussion platform for Guernsey but was not used enough to justify the on-going costs. Read about the closure <a href="post/2019-09-09-closing-up-discuss-gg/">here</a>.
