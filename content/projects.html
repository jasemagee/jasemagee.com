<p>In addition to the projects listed below, I've explored various other interests, including creating
    <a href="/wallpapers">wallpapers</a> with Blender, developing

<h2>data.gg</h2>

<p><a href="https://data.gg">data.gg</a> is the brainchild of Jason Magee and Kieran Senior, aimed at providing all Bailiwick of Guernsey-related data to the public through an easily accessible API available in multiple formats. We currently support XML, JSON, and HTML, with plans to include Object data formats and gzipped formats in the future. data.gg is and will always remain a non-profit initiative.

<h2>Gamely Digest (Deceased)</h2>

<p>
    <a href="https://gamelydigest.com/">Gamely Digest</a> was a collaborative project with my friend Nik, focused on video game reviews.
