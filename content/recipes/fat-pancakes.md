These are the smaller, fat ones. Think they're called American pancakes.

* 135g plain flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoon sugar
* 130ml milk
* 1 egg
* 2 tablespoon melted butter (let it cool)

Smash it into a bowl. Whisk, preferably with an electric one. Get about 10 pancakes. Double for more.
