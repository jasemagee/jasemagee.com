You need a pressure cooker for this. I put mine on Pasta mode and it takes about 10 minutes.

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup white wine
- 4 cups of broth. I usually do mushrooms and a vegetable stock cube.
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt (none if you use a stock cube - they are loaded)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper
- 1 cup whipping cream
- 4 ounce cream cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 lemon juice
- 226 g long pasta, like spaghetti or linguine
- 2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley chopped
- Smash into pressure cooker for pasta amount (10min). Let pressure naturally escape.
